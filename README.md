### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Hello World (also Josh...)
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Arkahna's training offering of Power Virtual Agents in a Day course material.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github funsies.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my side-gig TTRPG work.

âš¡ Fun fact: I nearly died when a giant tanker missed the navy ship I was on by a matter of feet when it was cold-drifting through a port bay during a hurricane in Tokyo bay.
